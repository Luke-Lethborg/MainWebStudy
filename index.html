<h1>About</h1>
<p>I built the bulk of this webpage on Easter Monday 21/04/2025.<br/> 
This is 63 pages in Word in print mode.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29/04/2025 - Added the Work in Progress #01 to the end</p>
  
<p>This is the page I will gather all the web study ideas together.</p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to consolidate all my learning and stop spreading my study all over the place.</p>
<p>This will be hosted on a real website (Paid Domain, Free Website with Ads, Cloud, Own Hosted Web Server) ..I have not decided yet!</p>
<p>This page will use GitHub to store progress and prevent code loss.</p>
<p>The page will have my notes in docx form</p>
<p>The idea is to get the basics down so I can progress to more advanced topics.</p>
<p>This page will contain links that go off to other projects like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 / CSS / JavaScript</li>
  <li>DOM, BOM, Forms</li>
  <li>JQuery</li>
  <li>Other JavaScript libraries like Date.js, Plotly.js for graphs and so on</li>
  <li>React (Library)</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li>
  <li>Angular (Framework)</li>
  <li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Blazor</li>
  <li>SAPUI5</li>
  <li></li>

  <li>Vue</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Spring Framework</li>
  <li>Python Django (Large App)</li>
  <li>Python Flask  (Small App)</li>
  <li>Use Paid Web Builders like: GoDaddy, Wix, Wordpress, Shopify</li>
  <li>Web Servers: Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Nginx web server, Node.js</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not all, see below</p>
<p>I will also use this page to start making utility programs for myself.</p>
<p>I also want to try and use Web to access Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like C++, Java, C#</p>
<p>Latter I can link of to some AI like programs perhaps</p>
<p>As I do each topic will discuss issues, how-to's and if it can be done in standard web development.</p>
<br/>

<p>Consider changes and improvements to web:</p>
<p>This is not all but we can agree these did shack on the world!</p>
<p>Other things like Twitter, Elon Musk buys twitter and so on can be left off. This is not intended to be a history page.</p>
<p>Main Categories: Buying, Banking, Socializing, Gaming, Video Streaming, Content Creation</p>
<p>I think Creator/CEO/Founder/Programmer names are important too!</p>

<li>Fall of big media companies (Not due to AI, but lack of interest or trust)</li>
<li>Common Access to all AI features: Video, Image, Audio, Ideas, Problem Solving</li>
<li>AI being able to make movies and games. At first it will feel B-Grade</li>
<li>Gaming, Movies, Music becoming more expensive and harder to access</li>
<li>A reliance on AI and no critical thinking or skills</li>
<li>Control of information and full trust in AI despite alternative  options</li>
<li>Scrubbing of undesirable information that makes large companies look bad</li>
<li>Inability for small companies and new ideas to gain a foothold</li>
<li>Fear of speaking out due reduction of service or monetization</li>
<li>Control on how much, when, what and where people can spend their money</li>

<h1>Start: Web_Ideas.pptx slide PowerPoint</h1>
<h1>About</h1>
<p>I have made Web_Ideas.pptx which is a 20 slide PowerPoint</p>
<pre>
It would be cool to have my own study web page with fully functional code.
Study Notes (Word, PDF)
..A means to update perhaps notes
Each Step
Code in GitHub
Overview of planned learning
Progress Tracker
Issue Raised

Need to stop learning and forgetting
Stop loosing my notes
Stop not having access to what I make
Begin to be able to build on top of what I make.
Begin to do further studies.

Try and be able to call Java, C# and C++ code on webpage.
</pre>

<pre>
These web pages will be hosted.
Notes will be available.
Code will be on GitGub
Code can link to other sites I make.

The idea is to have a starting 
Point for the future.

Eg:/ I have done Angular 
Tour of Heroes and I want to extend.

</pre>

<pre>
Purpose of this web pages to have a range of Web Projects that I can link off too. 

The idea is to start simple and show the difference before moving on.

By the end I will be proficient in Full Stack Development in both Angular and React

I will have a robust page like Flight Centre, JB Hi-Fi or Domain.

I will have a log in area where one can go in and adjust t their settings.

The page will allow many users at once.
</pre>

<pre>
Idea is not to be bogged down.
Eg:/ SAPUI5 is a big topic

Start Small
Break things up, eg: JavaScript Dates
Or ASP.NET 3 hour

Do Basics first.
Learn JavaScript, Then JQuery, Then TypeScript then Angular

The idea is to have a cheat sheet, review code I worked on and abandoned and remember all the study I have done and have quick access to core notes.

There is no reason I can’t be a successful, respected and proficient developer.

</pre>

<h1>The Approach:</h1>
<pre>
#1
Do HTML
Do CSS 
Do JavaScript (Split JavaScript into sections)
Upload as Version01 to GitHub
</pre>

<pre>
#?
Do ASP.NET REST 3 hour
In the mean while learn some ASP.NET
</pre>

<pre>
#2 
Fix up SAPUI5
Do the JavaScript Version
Fork from existing GitHub
Use existing code and compare what is in the .zips
</pre>

<pre>
#3
Learn TypeScript
W3 and Official Page
Upload to GitHub
</pre>

<pre>
#4
 Fix up SAPUI5 to TypeScipt
Do the JavaScript Version
Upload to GitHub
Use existing code and compare what is in the .zips
</pre>

<pre>

Do Angular 
..House v19
…. Upload as Version 03 to Github
..Tour of Heroes v17
…. Upload as Version 04 to Github
** Do Angular after SAPUI5 as I have more exposure to SAPUI5.

  <li>Write a simple OData V4 service [003]</li>
</ul>

<pre>
I want to learn ASP.NET as it seems the fastest way to get things working and it seems to me that it is Microsoft who are pushing these terms I am unfamiliar with like asyc

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/ has 35 entries for ASP.NET . My Page will likely have all these. Then there are all the YouTube videos. Blazor has 15.

<h2>ASP.Net Core Web.txt</h2>
<pre>
ASP.Net Core Web.txt
ToDo: Add the video I got this from.

5 Different ASP.Net Core Project Types for the web

Web Forms is gone
#1 API Project Type
..No GUI
..Usually Returns JSON Data (Can be XML)
..You Call
..Swash Buckle can give GUI on a API
..App to App Communication

Angular, React, Vue, WPF, Blazor, all these front ends consume API
WPF?
Mobile can also consume an API
API has Business Logic, Data Access Code, Encryption, Authentication, Authroization

#2 Razor Pages Project Type
ASP.NET Core
Quick, low overhead pages
Mostly Static
Server Side Rendered and Quick
You can mix these Project Types

#3 MVC Project Type
C# Started with Webforms (Winforms for the Web)
.. Drag and Drop
.. Does not work in the modern web.
.. More Legacy
.. GUI and API together

#4 Blazor Server project Type
Both Client and Server
PHP is Server Side rendered
Client side render is what Angular, React and Vue do
..JavaScript frameworks download to the client
..These pages are very interactive.
Uses SingleR
Online Only
Supports 1000's of clients, one machine can support 20,000+ clients.
..For more, off load SingleR connection Azure SingleR service and scale higher
..You could pull up a second machine and have 40,000 clients
..These are concurrent connections


#5 Blazor Web Assembly project Type
All Client Side
Includes C# Code
Do not put secure stuff here
You can't talk to a database directly.
You can't have private keys
??? Json File
Allows offline access
Local Storage or Session Storage
Progressive Web Application
Acts like a Desktop Application
Often you add a API
Need 2 Projects
Blazor Assembly does send C# to client


Blazor lets you reuse existing code. Libraries, Code Patterns, Helper Methods
